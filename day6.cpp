/* # 797
   All Paths From Source to Target
    Given source is vertex 0 and target is vertex N-1.

   Input: [[1,2[, [3], [3], []]
   Output: [[0,1,3], [0,2,3]]
   Explanation: The graph looks like this:
   
   0-->1
   |   |
   v   v
   2-->3

   There are two paths: 0->1->3 and 0->2->3

   Given graph is directed acyclic graph of N nodes.
    What algorthims work best on directed graphs?

    Acyclic?
